“Rubix Cube” is one among the easiest Computer Graphics Projects. The original game is a 2 Dimensional game that involves swapping of any 2 tiles and arranging the tiles in the correct sequence. We modified this idea to include a blank position. This now increases level of difficulty as only the tiles adjacent to the blank position can now be translated, unlike the Puzzle Slider game.
